- [x] Edit src/game/input.js to increase JUMP_VELOCITY from -600 to -800 * scale
- [x] Edit src/game/game.js to decrease gravity from 2000 to 1500
- [x] Edit src/game/player.js to decrease MIN_JUMP_HEIGHT from 60 to 40 * scale
- [x] Decrease JUMP_VELOCITY from -800 * scale to -600 * scale to reduce jump height
- [x] Increase gravity from 1500 to 2000 to make jump reach peak faster
- [x] Test the game to ensure jump feels lower and quicker to peak
